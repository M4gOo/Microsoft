IT - use digital tech to sotre and process data into useful info.

IT support specialist make sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. 

hackers and other risk. For me my favorite part of IT support is the problem solving aspects. I love to exercise my creativity to spin up a solution to a user's issue.
Being an IT generalist also gave me the flexibility to learn and practice so many different skills and eventually determine where I want to focus on my career

Using failure as a feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life, that's why I was so attracted to the IT field. 

As long as you're able to get to a point where you feel comfortable working with users, fixing their problems and supporting them in the best way for you and them.

We're starting to understand that technology is ubiquitous, everyone uses it, why can't everyone support it as well?

I enjoy learning I enjoy learning a lot of things. I enjoy picking up new skills. Technology is a real equalizer 
I think what's available now is amazing and I think I wish I'd had that ten years ago when I started.

As an IT professional, you may be required to maintain two or more versions of an operating system at the same time. IT professionals need to stay on top of changes and new development to ensure they can support their users. 

when you make a mistake you learn about troubleshooting and how to fix bugs.


You're able to see something from someone else's perspective and understand their feelings. Empathy

Tone is historically thought of as how you speak out loud. 
In this technological age, when many of our interactions over texts and IT support is increasingly done remotely, tone isn't just about 
how you come off during an in person conversation. It's expanded into how you write, punctuate, and even spell. If your tone is short or blunt, 
then the user will feel brush off and devalued. 
But if your tone is friendly and curious, the user's much more likely to have a positive experience working with you. 

 How you ask a question and how you respond to user's question matters.

Whenever possible, acknowledge the user. This reduces the tension that might build and helps you understand how you're working toward a solution. 

Would you mind waiting about five minutes or less while I do that? They'd probably say sure, and keep themselves occupied while they wait. They'd also feel more confident in your ability to resolve the issue. 

Don't make something up to a user because you think it will help in the moment. Be honest with the user, even if you think they won't be happy about it and never be afraid to admit when you're wrong.

Do your best to give the user the benefit of the doubt whenever possible.

'first impressions last a lifetime'?

Hi, Gail. How are you today? Not great. It's been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed. Sorry to hear that. 
Let's see what we can do to turn that around.

The next critical step in an interaction is how you respond to the user's questions. If they're taking the time to explain to you what happened
Remember to integrate the information you've been given into your conversation.

 "Hi, Rhori. I hope you're having a good day despite your computer randomly turning off. Let's see what we can do to fix your issue."

 If they start asking you a bunch of questions while you're still troubleshooting, you can do two things. First option, 
you can ignore them because they're just talking out loud. Second option, you can pause and say something like,
"I'd be happy to answer all of your questions, but I want to look up this one first. I've written them all down though, so I won't forget them


If you're not the type to engage in small talk, skip it. 

Now, you're getting to the point where you're ready to troubleshoot, just make sure you clarify the person's issue before you start to troubleshoot.

"In order for me to figure out what's really going on, I need to ask you some question," can make all the difference.

 If you're supporting a user remotely and need them to run some commands, don't forget to tell them why you need them to execute the commands. 
There's no need to go into a ton of detail. Without some context, you could strain the trust you've built. Make sure that when you're asking these questions or asking the user to run a command,
you're really listening to the response, those little nuggets of information may help solve the issue. 

The last five minutes of the interaction will set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction. Make sure to end on a positive note. You might have solved their issue, 
but if they don't feel it was resolved or they're unsure of the next steps, then they're going to walk away feeling like it was a poor solution. How do you make a good final impression? Simple, 
reiterate the resolution, state the next steps, then ask the user if they have any questions.

The user gets annoyed and then starts typing in all caps, a clear sign they're irritated. In this case, the cause seems obvious. If the user didn't understand the question, then they probably 
got frustrated when the same question was asked over and over. If the IT support specialist had noticed this, they could have reframe the question and broken it down further.

I completely understand. Can you let me have five minutes to do a quick triage and then we can discuss next steps? 

What you can write down and memorize is your elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a short summary of who you are and what kind of career you're looking for. 
Make sure to include information like what you're passionate about, how you would like to grow, and what you're looking for in a new role.

Having a good problem solving strategy is more important than knowing all the answers.

Getting priorities right. 
Time-sensitive issues usually have higher priority, but issues that are preventing a large number of users from getting work done should be dealt with first, even if the person asking for help is a director or a VP.


----------------------------- binary ---------------------

The communication that a computer uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system. This means that it only talks in ones and zeros.

a group of eight bits is referred to as a byte. A byte of zeros and ones could look like 10011011. Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values 
In computer talk, this byte can mean something like the letter c. 
http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html
The ASCII lasted for a very long time, but eventually, it wasn't enough. Other character encoding standards were created to represent different languages, different amounts of characters, and more. 
Eventually, they would require more than 256 values we are allowed to have. 
Then came UTF-8, the most prevalent encoding standard used today. Along with having the same ASCII table, it also lets us use a variable number of bytes. 
It's not possible to make emojis with a single byte since we can only store one character in a byte. 
Instead, UTF-8 allows us to store a character in more than one byte, which means endless emoji fun. UTF-8 is built off the Unicode Standard.
the Unicode Standard helps us represent character encoding in a consistent manner. Now that we've been able to represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and even emojis,

Binary in today's computer uses electricity via transistors allowing electrical signals to pass through. If there's an electric voltage, we would denote it as one, if there isn't, we would denote it by zero. 
Today we have something known as logic gates. Logic gates allow our transistors to do more complex tasks like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions. 
how we're able to turn human-readable instructions into zeros and ones that our computer understands through compilers.
That's one of the very basic building blocks of programming that's led to the creation of our favorite social media sites, video games, and just about everything else.

There are 256 values in a byte, from the decimal number 0 to 255, which is the highest value since the count starts at 0. 

Decimal nomenclature: kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte
Binary nomenclature: kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte - (example: megabyte + binary + byte= mebibyte)

------------------------------------------------------------------

 The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the system. Hardware is created by many different manufacturers. The operating system allows them to be used with our system regardless of where it came from.


================= hardware ====================

CPUs that have 32-bit or 64-bit architecture are just specifying how much data they can efficiently handle.

Every motherboard has a few key characteristics. First is the chipset, which decides how components talk to each other on our machine. 
The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards. 
The other chip is the Southbridge, which maintains our IO or input-output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices, that input and output data.

MB is megabyte (unit of storage)
Mb/s is megabit per second (unit of data transfer rate)
To transfer a one megabyte file in a second, you need an eight megabits per second connection speed.

-------------- PROJECTOR

if your computer does not correctly recognize the display resolution of the projector it may default to a very low-resolution VGA mode like 640x480 or 1024x768. 
If this happens, your computer may need a device driver for your projector. 
Take a look at the support website for your projector's manufacturer!


--------------- BIOS

 The BIOS is software that is stored permanently on hardware means it is a firmware
The bios isn't stored on a hard drive. 
Our motherboard stores the bios in a special type of memory called the read only memory chip (ROM chip) 
Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volatile, meaning it won't erase the data if the computer is turned off. 


When you turn on a computer, our computers run a test to make sure all the hardware is working correctly. 
This is called a power-on self-test (POST). The bios runs it when you boot up your computer. 
The POST figures out what hardware is on the computer. It happens before the BIOS initializes any hardware or loads up essential drivers. 

CMOS chip stores basic data about boosting your computer, like the date, time, and how you want it to start up. 

-------------- anti-static
How do we prevent static discharge? We can go about this in two ways. 
You can touch an electrical device that's plugged in but not powered on. Fyi, you should do this every couple of minutes when assembling a new computer. 
Another option is to wear an anti-static wristband


=================== Operating System

There are two main parts to an operating system, the kernel and the user space. 

The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our system's resources.
The user space is everything outside the kernel. These are the things that we interact with directly, like programs such as text editors, music players, system settings, user interfaces, etcetera.

Random Access Memory (RAM) Support Limitations: In Windows 10, the lowest RAM (Random Access Memory) requirements are 1GB for 32-bit versions and 2GB for 64-bit versions. In Windows 11, the base requirement is 4GB of RAM.

Bitlocker: Bitlocker, a drive encryption tool included with Windows, is largely unchanged. Note that Bitlocker is only available for Pro and Enterprise licenses of Windows.


ChromeOS are that it's extremely simple to use and very hard for users to meddle with. Since users don't have administrator rights on their ChromeOS machines, they won't be able to alter the system configuration. 
Also, ChromeOS has an automatic update mechanism that includes a fail-safe in case anything goes wrong. 
This means that the user doesn't need to worry about problems or hacks in the system because it's designed to stay up and running. 


---kernel 

The BIOS lives in your motherboard. The kernel lives in your boot drive

The kernel does file storage and file management.

Another important function of the kernel is process management. We have many programs that we want to run on our system. To run them we manage the order they run in,
how many resources they take up, how long they run, etc. Our kernel helps us do this with its process management capabilities.

The process scheduler is part of the kernel that makes this multitasking possible. It switches the execution of each different process on the CPU faster than you can blink 
and it gives you the illusion that things are happening simultaneously. 

 Our kernel optimizes memory usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run. 

kernel performs input, output or IO management. This is how our kernel talks to external devices, like disks, keyboards, networks, connections, audio devices and more


=================== File System

 There are three main components to handling files handlers, the file data, metadata, and file system.
 new hard disks that we want to store data on, we need to erase and configure the disk. This way operating system can read and write data to it. This is important since it's how our operating system keeps tracks of files.
Some file systems support the storage of large amounts of data others only support small amounts. They can operate in different speeds and have varying resiliency towards file corruption and so on.

For Windows, the major file system that's used is NTFS.
For Linux, different distributions will use different file system types. A standard for file systems for Linux is EXT4.
 A good guideline to use is just to use the file system that your operating system recommends. 

file management is the storage of actual file data.
We write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks. When we say something to our hard disks, it doesn't always sit in one piece. It can be broken down into many pieces and written to different parts of the disk. 
Block storage improves faster handling of data, because the data isn't stored on one long piece, and it can be accessed quicker. It's also better for utilizing storage space. 

we need to keep the metadata that contains the information about our file. There's a lot of information about our file that we want to know, who created it, when it was last modified, who has access to it, and so on. 
The file metadata tells us everything we need to know about our file, also tells us what type of file it is. A file extension is the appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems.


========================== Process Management

kernel on of the taks is process management. A process is a program that's executing, like our Internet browser, text editor, a program like Chrome 
We can have many processes of the same program running at the same time (Chrome windows you can opened at the same time). These are all different processes for the same program.

Our kernel has to manage our resources efficiently so that all the programs we want to use can be run. 
Our system is actually constantly running multiple processes that are necessary for it to function. Our kernel has to worry about all of these processes at once.

----- CPU
It executes processes one-by-one through something known as a time slice. A time slice is a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.

----Memory
When processes are run, they have to take up space in memory, so that the computer can read and load them quickly. 
compared to our hard disk drives, memory comes in smaller quantities. So to give us more memory than we physically have, we use something called virtual memory. 
Virtual memory is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks we call pages. We store these pages in virtual memory. If we want to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to physical memory or RAM. 
When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space swap space.
It handles the process of taking pages of data and swapping them between RAM and virtual memory.


-----I/O
I/O devices are all managed by our kernel, the kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware

When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency. 


====== userspace

There are two ways that we can interact with our OS. With a shell or graphical user interface. 
A shell is basically a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.


==================== THE BOOT PROCESS =====================

Booting a computer or starting a computer, it means to start from nothing and follow a series of steps to arrive at a fully operational system

First, the computer is powered on. 
The BIOS/UEFI is a low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go. The bios UEFI runs a process called the power-on self-test, or post. 
The post performs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order. 
Next, depending on the bios or UEFI configuration of boot device will be selected. The devices will be checked in this order and the computer will search for what's known as a bootloader. 
The BIOS will run the first bootloader that it finds.
The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system. Once our computer finds a bootloader on a device in the listed order, it will start to execute this program. 
Once the bootloader loads up our operating system, our kernel gets loaded. 
The kernel controls access to our computer's resources. It also loads up drivers and more so that our hardware can talk to our software.
Next, essential system processes and user space items are launched. These include processes like user login, spinning up a desktop environment, and more which basically allows us to interact with our system. 


having two operating systems can be helpful for various reasons, it is especially helpful when one system is failing or unable to boot. 
If this happens, you can still boot the computer using the other system and troubleshoot from there. 

The USB drive and optical media methods are useful for recovering a computer with a corrupted OS. They can also be used to start up a computer with a different OS. 
For example, you might boot a Windows computer in a Linux environment by using a USB with Linux OS

 To load the image onto your USB device and make it bootable, you can use a tool like etcher.io

========================= Virtual Machines

A virtual machine is just a copy of a real machine.
I can use an application like Virtual Box to install Linux, and have it completely isolated from my machine. 
Virtual machines use physical resources like memory, CPU, and storage, but they offer the added benefit of running multiple operating systems at once. 



===================== networking

IP is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers. The Internet Protocol helps us route information. 
The Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, is a protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. 


All websites can be accessed through the web. Websites are basically text documents that we format with HTML or HyperText Markup Language. It's a coding language used by web browsers. 


====================== software

programs are instructions that are given to a CPU. We can send binary code or bits to our CPU, then they'll use an instruction set to run those commands.
But these CPUS might be from different manufacturers and may have different instructions.
There might even be all kinds of different hardware components like video cards and hard drives that also have their own special interfaces.
We can write a program for each possible combination of CPU and hardware using the native languages and interfaces of these components, 
but there are potentially millions of possible configurations of hardware. 
Better way is, the efforts of computer scientists and the principle of abstraction, we can now use programming languages to write instructions that can be run on any hardware.


A program was needed that could run on many types of CPUs, enter compiled programming languages. A compiled programming language uses human readable instructions and sends them through a compiler. 
The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions. 

Along the way, another type of language emerged that was interpreted rather than compiled, interpreted languages aren't compiled ahead-of-time.
A file that has code written in one of these languages is usually called a script. The script is run by an interpreter which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them.

Developers are releasing updates. Software companies change, features are added, and so on. This constant change is completely out of our control and it can cause a lot of headaches in the IT world.
You should always test new software before letting your company use it. Another thing to worry about is old software. 
When you run old software on your machine, you risk being exposed to cyber security attacks that take advantage of software bugs.
