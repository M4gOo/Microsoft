IT - use digital tech to sotre and process data into useful info.

IT support specialist make sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. 

hackers and other risk. For me my favorite part of IT support is the problem solving aspects. I love to exercise my creativity to spin up a solution to a user's issue.
Being an IT generalist also gave me the flexibility to learn and practice so many different skills and eventually determine where I want to focus on my career

Using failure as a feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life, that's why I was so attracted to the IT field. 

 As long as you're able to get to a point where you feel comfortable working with users, fixing their problems and supporting them in the best way for you and them.

We're starting to understand that technology is ubiquitous, everyone uses it, why can't everyone support it as well?

----------------------------- binary ---------------------

The communication that a computer uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system. This means that it only talks in ones and zeros.

a group of eight bits is referred to as a byte. A byte of zeros and ones could look like 10011011. Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values 
In computer talk, this byte can mean something like the letter c.

The ASCII lasted for a very long time, but eventually, it wasn't enough. Other character encoding standards were created to represent different languages, different amounts of characters, and more. 
Eventually, they would require more than 256 values we are allowed to have. 
Then came UTF-8, the most prevalent encoding standard used today. Along with having the same ASCII table, it also lets us use a variable number of bytes. 
It's not possible to make emojis with a single byte since we can only store one character in a byte. 
Instead, UTF-8 allows us to store a character in more than one byte, which means endless emoji fun. UTF-8 is built off the Unicode Standard.
the Unicode Standard helps us represent character encoding in a consistent manner. Now that we've been able to represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and even emojis,

Binary in today's computer uses electricity via transistors allowing electrical signals to pass through. If there's an electric voltage, we would denote it as one, if there isn't, we would denote it by zero. 
Today we have something known as logic gates. Logic gates allow our transistors to do more complex tasks like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions. 
how we're able to turn human-readable instructions into zeros and ones that our computer understands through compilers.
That's one of the very basic building blocks of programming that's led to the creation of our favorite social media sites, video games, and just about everything else.

There are 256 values in a byte, from the decimal number 0 to 255, which is the highest value since the count starts at 0. 

Decimal nomenclature: kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte
Binary nomenclature: kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte - (example: megabyte + binary + byte= mebibyte)

 The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the system. Hardware is created by many different manufacturers. The operating system allows them to be used with our system regardless of where it came from.


================= hardware ====================

CPUs that have 32-bit or 64-bit architecture are just specifying how much data they can efficiently handle.

Every motherboard has a few key characteristics. First is the chipset, which decides how components talk to each other on our machine. 
The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards. 
The other chip is the Southbridge, which maintains our IO or input-output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices, that input and output data.
