IT - use digital tech to sotre and process data into useful info.

IT support specialist make sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. 

hackers and other risk. For me my favorite part of IT support is the problem solving aspects. I love to exercise my creativity to spin up a solution to a user's issue.
Being an IT generalist also gave me the flexibility to learn and practice so many different skills and eventually determine where I want to focus on my career

Using failure as a feedback is an important skill both in IT and in life, that's why I was so attracted to the IT field. 

 As long as you're able to get to a point where you feel comfortable working with users, fixing their problems and supporting them in the best way for you and them.

We're starting to understand that technology is ubiquitous, everyone uses it, why can't everyone support it as well?

----------------------------- binary ---------------------

The communication that a computer uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system. This means that it only talks in ones and zeros.

a group of eight bits is referred to as a byte. A byte of zeros and ones could look like 10011011. Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values 
In computer talk, this byte can mean something like the letter c.

The ASCII lasted for a very long time, but eventually, it wasn't enough. Other character encoding standards were created to represent different languages, different amounts of characters, and more. 
Eventually, they would require more than 256 values we are allowed to have. 
Then came UTF-8, the most prevalent encoding standard used today. Along with having the same ASCII table, it also lets us use a variable number of bytes. 
It's not possible to make emojis with a single byte since we can only store one character in a byte. 
Instead, UTF-8 allows us to store a character in more than one byte, which means endless emoji fun. UTF-8 is built off the Unicode Standard.
the Unicode Standard helps us represent character encoding in a consistent manner. Now that we've been able to represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and even emojis,

Binary in today's computer uses electricity via transistors allowing electrical signals to pass through. If there's an electric voltage, we would denote it as one, if there isn't, we would denote it by zero. 
Today we have something known as logic gates. Logic gates allow our transistors to do more complex tasks like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions. 
how we're able to turn human-readable instructions into zeros and ones that our computer understands through compilers.
That's one of the very basic building blocks of programming that's led to the creation of our favorite social media sites, video games, and just about everything else.

There are 256 values in a byte, from the decimal number 0 to 255, which is the highest value since the count starts at 0. 

Decimal nomenclature: kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte
Binary nomenclature: kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte - (example: megabyte + binary + byte= mebibyte)

------------------------------------------------------------------

 The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the system. Hardware is created by many different manufacturers. The operating system allows them to be used with our system regardless of where it came from.


================= hardware ====================

CPUs that have 32-bit or 64-bit architecture are just specifying how much data they can efficiently handle.

Every motherboard has a few key characteristics. First is the chipset, which decides how components talk to each other on our machine. 
The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards. 
The other chip is the Southbridge, which maintains our IO or input-output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices, that input and output data.

MB is megabyte (unit of storage)
Mb/s is megabit per second (unit of data transfer rate)
To transfer a one megabyte file in a second, you need an eight megabits per second connection speed.

-------------- PROJECTOR

if your computer does not correctly recognize the display resolution of the projector it may default to a very low-resolution VGA mode like 640x480 or 1024x768. 
If this happens, your computer may need a device driver for your projector. 
Take a look at the support website for your projector's manufacturer!


--------------- BIOS

The bios isn't stored on a hard drive. 
Our motherboard stores the bios in a special type of memory called the read only memory chip (ROM chip) 
Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volatile, meaning it won't erase the data if the computer is turned off. 


When you turn on a computer, our computers run a test to make sure all the hardware is working correctly. 
This is called a power-on self-test (POST). The bios runs it when you boot up your computer. 
The POST figures out what hardware is on the computer. It happens before the BIOS initializes any hardware or loads up essential drivers. 

CMOS chip stores basic data about boosting your computer, like the date, time, and how you want it to start up. 

-------------- anti-static
How do we prevent static discharge? We can go about this in two ways. 
You can touch an electrical device that's plugged in but not powered on. Fyi, you should do this every couple of minutes when assembling a new computer. 
Another option is to wear an anti-static wristband


=================== Operating System

There are two main parts to an operating system, the kernel and the user space. 

The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our system's resources.
The user space is everything outside the kernel. These are the things that we interact with directly, like programs such as text editors, music players, system settings, user interfaces, etcetera.

---kernel 

The BIOS lives in your motherboard. The kernel lives in your boot drive

The kernel does file storage and file management.

Another important function of the kernel is process management. We have many programs that we want to run on our system. To run them we manage the order they run in,
how many resources they take up, how long they run, etc. Our kernel helps us do this with its process management capabilities.

The process scheduler is part of the kernel that makes this multitasking possible. It switches the execution of each different process on the CPU faster than you can blink 
and it gives you the illusion that things are happening simultaneously. 

 Our kernel optimizes memory usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run. 

kernel performs input, output or IO management. This is how our kernel talks to external devices, like disks, keyboards, networks, connections, audio devices and more


=================== File System

 There are three main components to handling files handlers, the file data, metadata, and file system.
 new hard disks that we want to store data on, we need to erase and configure the disk. This way operating system can read and write data to it. This is important since it's how our operating system keeps tracks of files.
Some file systems support the storage of large amounts of data others only support small amounts. They can operate in different speeds and have varying resiliency towards file corruption and so on.

For Windows, the major file system that's used is NTFS.
For Linux, different distributions will use different file system types. A standard for file systems for Linux is EXT4.
 A good guideline to use is just to use the file system that your operating system recommends. 

file management is the storage of actual file data.
We write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks. When we say something to our hard disks, it doesn't always sit in one piece. It can be broken down into many pieces and written to different parts of the disk. 
Block storage improves faster handling of data, because the data isn't stored on one long piece, and it can be accessed quicker. It's also better for utilizing storage space. 

we need to keep the metadata that contains the information about our file. There's a lot of information about our file that we want to know, who created it, when it was last modified, who has access to it, and so on. 
The file metadata tells us everything we need to know about our file, also tells us what type of file it is. A file extension is the appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems.


========================== Process Management

kernel on of the taks is process management. A process is a program that's executing, like our Internet browser, text editor, a program like Chrome 
We can have many processes of the same program running at the same time (Chrome windows you can opened at the same time). These are all different processes for the same program.

Our kernel has to manage our resources efficiently so that all the programs we want to use can be run. 
Our system is actually constantly running multiple processes that are necessary for it to function. Our kernel has to worry about all of these processes at once.

----- CPU
It executes processes one-by-one through something known as a time slice. A time slice is a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.

----Memory
When processes are run, they have to take up space in memory, so that the computer can read and load them quickly. 
compared to our hard disk drives, memory comes in smaller quantities. So to give us more memory than we physically have, we use something called virtual memory. 
Virtual memory is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks we call pages. We store these pages in virtual memory. If we want to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to physical memory or RAM. 
When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space swap space.
It handles the process of taking pages of data and swapping them between RAM and virtual memory.


-----I/O
I/O devices are all managed by our kernel, the kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware

When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency. 


====== userspace

There are two ways that we can interact with our OS. With a shell or graphical user interface. 
A shell is basically a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.


==================== THE BOOT PROCESS =====================

Booting a computer or starting a computer, it means to start from nothing and follow a series of steps to arrive at a fully operational system

First, the computer is powered on. 
The BIOS/UEFI is a low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go. The bios UEFI runs a process called the power-on self-test, or post. 
The post performs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order. 
Next, depending on the bios or UEFI configuration of boot device will be selected. The devices will be checked in this order and the computer will search for what's known as a bootloader. 
The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system. Once our computer finds a bootloader on a device in the listed order, it will start to execute this program. 
Once the bootloader loads up our operating system, our kernel gets loaded. 
The kernel controls access to our computer's resources. It also loads up drivers and more so that our hardware can talk to our software.
Next, essential system processes and user space items are launched. These include processes like user login, spinning up a desktop environment, and more which basically allows us to interact with our system.
